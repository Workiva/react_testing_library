# Testing Library for Dart

[Dart] bindings for the JS [dom-testing-library] and [react-testing-library] packages, which provide simple and complete DOM/React testing utilities that encourage good testing practices.

## Introduction

The libraries in this package help you to test Dart UI components in a user-centric way. 

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.][testing-library-intro]

To paint the full picture of how / why to use this library, **please read the JS Testing Library [Introduction][testing-library-intro], [Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles) and [FAQs](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/faq).**

## How Does It Work?

Rather than dealing with [OverReact] `UiComponent` instances, or React VDom `ReactElement`s, your tests will work with actual DOM nodes. The utilities this library provides facilitate **querying the DOM in the same way the user would.** Finding form elements by their label text *(just like a user would)*, finding links and buttons from their text *(like a user would)*. It also exposes a recommended way to find elements by an HTML `data-test-id` attribute value as an "escape hatch" for elements where the text content and label do not make sense or is not practical.

**This library encourages your Dart web applications to be more accessible** and allows you to get your tests closer to using your components the way a user will, which allows your tests to give you more confidence that your application will work when a real user uses it.


## Getting Started

> Before using this library, you should familiarize yourself with [Dart](https://dart.dev/overview), [Dart's `test` library][dart_test_lib], [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [OverReact] first.

### 1. Add the necessary dependencies to your project

<figure>
<figcaption>pubspec.yaml</figcaption>

```yaml
dependencies:
  over_react: ^4.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.7.1
  build_test: ">=0.10.9 <3.0.0"
  build_web_compilers: ^2.9.0
  react_testing_library: ^1.1.4
  test: ^1.14.4
  # This is not technically required, 
  # but makes the HTML portion of your test bootstrapping much easier!
  test_html_builder: ^1.0.0 
```
</figure>

### 2. Configure `build.yaml` to generate test outputs

<figure>
<figcaption>build.yaml</figcaption>

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        # These are globs for the entrypoints you want to compile.
        generate_for:
          - test/**.browser_test.dart
```
</figure>

> The configuration above is a minimum recommendation only. [Read more about configuring a Dart build][dart_build_config] to learn more / ensure your configuration meets your needs.


### 3. Configure `dart_test.yaml` to run your tests

Create `dart_test.yaml` in the root of your project. 

<figure>
<figcaption>dart_test.yaml</figcaption>

```yaml
platforms:
  - chrome

paths:
  - test/unit/
```
</figure>

> The configuration above is a minimum recommendation only. [Read more about configuring Dart tests][dart_test_config], or about [Dart's `test` library][dart_test_lib] to learn more / ensure your configuration meets your needs.


### 4. Add an HTML template for your tests that will load the necessary React / react-testing-library JS files

> *NOTE: The names of the files below are recommendations only, and are not essential to a functional setup.*

#### Using test_html_builder (recommended)
We *strongly* recommend using the [test_html_builder] library to create a template that will be used to load each `.dart.js` test file.

<figure>
<figcaption>test/unit/rtl_unit_test_template.html</figcaption>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <title>React Testing Library Unit Test</title>
      <script src="packages/react/react.js"></script>
      <script src="packages/react/react_dom.js"></script>
      <script src="packages/react_testing_library/js/react-testing-library.js"></script>

      {test}
  </head>
</html>
```
</figure>

**Use the template `.html` file above and follow the [test_html_builder] library instructions for wiring it up!**

#### Adding / committing your own HTML file(s) 
If for some reason you do not wish to use the [test_html_builder] library to generate the necessary `.html` file(s), you must create one for each analogous `*_test.dart` file in which you are using `react_testing_library` as shown below. Note that you will have to have one `.html` file for each `.dart` file containing your unit tests.

<figure>
<figcaption>test/unit/some_unit_test.html</figcaption>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <title>Some Unit Test</title>
      <script src="packages/react/react.js"></script>
      <script src="packages/react/react_dom.js"></script>
      <script src="packages/react_testing_library/js/react-testing-library.js"></script>

      <link rel="x-dart-test" href="some_unit_test.dart">
      <script src="packages/test/dart.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```
</figure>

### 5. Write test(s) for your component(s)!

Using the [render] function, you can now generate DOM using React components and [query][queries] within that DOM to get the element(s) you want to test! 

Then, you can use the [`Matcher`s][matchers] from the `matchers.dart` entrypoint to perform assertions on that DOM, and the events and user events entrypoints or whatever to interact with the DOM.

mixin GreetingProps on UiProps {
  String heading;
  String subHeading;
  String getStartedRoute;

UiFactory<GreetingProps> Greeting = uiFunction(

    return (Dom.header()..role = 'group')(
      Dom.h1()(props.heading),
      Dom.h2()(props.subHeading),
      (Dom.a()..href = props.getStartedRoute)('Get started'),
    );
  },
  _$GreetingConfig, // ignore: undefined_identifier

        setUp(() {
          view = rtl.render((Greeting()
            ..heading = 'Hello There!'
            ..subHeading = 'Welcome to the unit testing party.'
            ..getStartedRoute = '/start/partying'
          )());
          
          headerElement = view.getByRole('group');
        });
        
        test('with a child <h1> with a text value equal to props.heading', () {
          final h1Element = rtl.within(headerElement).getByRole('heading', level: 1); 
          expect(h1Element, hasTextContent('Hello There!'));
        });
        
        test('with a child <h2> with a text value equal to props.subHeading', () {
          final h2Element = rtl.within(headerElement).getByRole('heading', level: 2); 
          expect(h2Element, hasTextContent('Welcome to the unit testing party.'));
        });
        
        test('with a child <a> with an href equal to props.getStartedRoute', () {
          final anchorElement = rtl.within(headerElement).getByRole('link'); 
          expect(anchorElement, hasAttribute('href', '/start/partying'));
        });
      });
    });
  });
}
```

## Migration Guides

* [OverReact Test to React Testing Library Migration Guide][migration-guide]: A guide to updating tests to use `react_testing_library` instead of [`over_react_test`][over-react-test].


## Dart / JS API Parity

The `react_testing_library` Dart package strives to maintain API parity with the analogous JS `testing-library` packages within reason. However, there are certain differences that are either unavoidable, or intentional for the purposes of building Dart APIs that are easy to use and reason about.
